# Happy Kittens Website

1. Project created in August 2018 using just HTML and CSS when I tested my skills and wanted to know if I can copy and adjust design of another website not looking into its code. Inspiration found here: https://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/.

2. Project updated in August and September 2019 with JS.

3. Code refactored in January 2020 before making it public (more changes described in dev changelog file).
